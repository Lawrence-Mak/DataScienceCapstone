# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

## Introduction

In this capstone, the aim is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website for 62 million dollars, significantly lower than competitors due to the ability to reuse the first stage. Accurately predicting first stage landings can determine launch costs, providing valuable insights for competitive bidding against SpaceX.

This project mirrors real-world data science processes, involving data collection, wrangling, exploratory analysis, visualization, model development, evaluation, and reporting. As a Data Scientist representing a startup competing with SpaceX, the goal is to predict the likelihood of successful Falcon 9 first stage landings.

## Business Problem

SpaceX's cost-efficient Falcon 9 launches, enabled by first stage reuse, pose a challenge for competing companies. Accurate prediction of first stage landing success is crucial for estimating launch costs. Leveraging data science, the objective is to empower the startup client to make informed bidding decisions against SpaceX.

## Objective

- Apply data science and machine learning to predict Falcon 9 first stage landing success and determine launch costs.
- Gain deeper insights from the data through exploration.

## Deliverables

- Accurate predictive algorithms
- Business case report for stakeholders
